# Runtime/Container Baseline – 2026-02-26

## Current state
- Snapshot mode requested; no running Podman containers were found at 2026-02-26 11:44:26 IST (`podman ps` and `podman ps -a` both reported zero entries).
- Unable to execute `.agents/skills/introspecor-container-performance-debug/scripts/monitor_container_perf.sh snapshot` because no container name could be supplied (the runtime itself is idle).

## Findings (P1/P2/P3)
1. **P1 – No active report-generation container**
   - Evidence: `podman ps` at 2026-02-26 11:44:26 IST returned no containers, so there is no runtime to inspect.
   - Likely impact: cannot collect CPU/RSS/log signatures or confirm bottlenecks; runtime evidence reporting is blocked until a container starts.
2. **P2 – Snapshot path remains unexercised**
   - Evidence: absence of a container also prevents the snapshot script from producing `stage_markers.log`, `samples.tsv`, or `summary.md` artifacts.
   - Likely impact: lack of baseline data makes it impossible to rank hotspots beyond noting the idle runtime state.
3. **P3 – (Placeholder) No observed CPU or RSS spikes**
   - Evidence: no runtime data available due to missing container.
   - Likely impact: no further runtime insights until the container is active.

## Evidence
- `podman ps` (2026-02-26 11:44:26 IST): empty listing (no CONTAINER IDs).
- `podman ps -a` (2026-02-26 11:44:26 IST): also empty.
- Snapshot script path `.agents/skills/introspecor-container-performance-debug/scripts/monitor_container_perf.sh snapshot --runtime podman` remains uninvoked because no container name was supplied.

## Suggested improvements
1. Start the report-generation container (e.g., `podman run ... build-introspector-full-generate-report`) and rerun the snapshot script to capture CPU/RSS trends and log-stage markers.
2. Once runtime data exists, rerun the monitoring script to collect `summary.md`, `stage_markers.log`, and `samples.tsv`, then rerank hotspots based on actual telemetry.
