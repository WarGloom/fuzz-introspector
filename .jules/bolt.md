## 2025-03-05 - Optimize Multimap Accumulation
**Learning:** Using `dict.setdefault(key, []).append(...)` for accumulating values into lists allocates an empty list on every single iteration, creating significant garbage collection pressure and CPU overhead in tight loops parsing debug info and profiling data. `collections.defaultdict(list)` avoids this allocation overhead and operates 30-50% faster.
**Action:** Always prefer `collections.defaultdict(list)` (or `set`) when constructing dictionary multimaps.

## 2025-02-28 - [Frontend Parsers Complexity Measurement Bottleneck]
**Learning:** The Tree-sitter frontend parsers (Go, JVM, Rust, C++) frequently measured node complexity and instruction counts recursively using an `in` operator on locally-scoped lists of string node types (e.g., `if node.type in branch_nodes`). This recreated the list and performed O(n) lookups on every single node traversal, creating a noticeable CPU overhead.
**Action:** Always extract static collections of constant items into module-level `set`s. Doing so changes the lookup from O(n) to O(1) and prevents re-allocation per method call, giving a ~70% speedup for these specific checks.

## 2025-03-05 - Avoid list re-creation for O(1) membership tests
**Learning:** Using an inline list `[...]` for membership checking (`in`) forces the Python interpreter to recreate the list object on every single execution, giving an O(N) lookup. Using an inline set `{...}` instead tells the compiler to pre-allocate a `frozenset` constant, saving list recreation and executing in O(1) time. We measured this to be 3-4x faster for a 5-element check (1.04s vs 0.27s over 10M iterations).
**Action:** Always prefer inline sets `{...}` over inline lists `[...]` for membership (`in`) checks.
## 2026-04-23 - O(N^2) bottlenecks when manually accumulating sets using list membership checks
**Learning:** Iterating over large items and checking if an item is not in an accumulator list (e.g., `if key not in function_name_list`) creates a massive (N^2)$ bottleneck that destroys performance on big data. Replacing the list with a `set` converts the check to (1)$. It's important to not accidentally modify the logic (e.g. if the original checked `key` but inserted `function_name`).
**Action:** Always verify if accumulator lists used with `if x not in arr` can be replaced with `sets` in hot loops.
